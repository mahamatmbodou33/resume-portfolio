Project Description
This project involves building a fully responsive and interactive portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website will showcase projects and skills in an elegant and user-friendly manner.

The website is hosted on an Amazon S3 bucket, leveraging its scalability and cost-effectiveness for static web hosting. AWS CloudFront is configured as a CDN (Content Delivery Network) to ensure security and fast content delivery, improving load times and caching efficiency across different geographic locations.

A custom domain is configured using AWS Route 53, providing a professional web presence with domain name management and DNS resolution. Additionally, SSL encryption is integrated via AWS Certificate Manager to ensure secure HTTPS connections, protecting user data and maintaining privacy.

The deployment process includes:

Designing and coding the portfolio website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Uploading website files to an Amazon S3 bucket and configuring it for static website hosting.

Setting up AWS CloudFront to cache content and serve it efficiently with lower latency.

Configuring a custom domain in AWS Route 53 and linking it to CloudFront.

Securing the website with SSL/TLS encryption through AWS Certificate Manager.

Testing and optimizing performance to ensure smooth functionality across devices and browsers.
